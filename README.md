## Hi there 👋 Welcome to Drag0n Power

We are an organization dedicated to developing apps and exploring mystical lore. This workspace serves as a top-level manager for our various repositories and projects.

### 🐉 About Us

We manage independent projects under one common umbrella. Our focus spans from software development to storytelling that blurs the lines between fiction and reality.

### 🔮 Current Projects

- **[Drag0n Blog](https://blog.drag0n.ca/)**: Dive into the world of dragons and other mystical lore.
- **Project Æ (Ash)**: A future focus where we are building a mystical ethereal egg called "Æ".
  - *Location*: [ae.drag0n.ca](https://ae.drag0n.ca)
  - *Repository*: [Drag0nPower/ae.drag0n.ca](https://github.com/Drag0nPower/ae.drag0n.ca) (Hosted on GitHub Pages)
  - *The Lore*: A fictional storyline oddly entwined with real-world events, sometimes almost predicting them. The lore is on the Blog.
